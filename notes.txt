Visual Studio 2012 notes
------------------------
implement ITestDiscoverer and ITestExecutor
create vsix for test runners
need msbuild test runner


General
-------
unit test the lib - started
create lib/include structure
ensure gcc/linux support
some duplicated code, search for FileAndLine (and others, but I forget which ones right now)


Stretch
-----
custom xUnitAsserts per assert (revisit unit tests at that point)
support wstring as an assert call parameter
create NuGet package/template (NuGet does not support C++ projects, yet)
