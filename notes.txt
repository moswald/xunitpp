Visual Studio 2012 notes
------------------------
will need to export a function that reports a list of tests
implement ITestDiscoverer and ITestExecutor


General
-------
see VS2012's implementation of method attributes
support wstring
consider doing LINEINFO the way VS2012 does
unit test the lib - started
custom xUnitAsserts per assert (revisit unit tests at that point)
xml output
