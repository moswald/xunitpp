Visual Studio 2012 notes
------------------------
will need to export a function that reports a list of tests
implement ITestDiscoverer and ITestExecutor


General
-------
unit test the lib - started
create lib/include structure, create NuGet package
ensure gcc support
xml output
support wstring
support versions of DoesNotContain/Contains that call find_if


"2.0"
-----
custom xUnitAsserts per assert (revisit unit tests at that point)
see VS2012's implementation of method attributes
consider doing LINEINFO the way VS2012 does
external test runner (since ITestExecutor will need the same thing)
