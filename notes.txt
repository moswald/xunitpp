Visual Studio 2012 notes
------------------------
implement ITestDiscoverer and ITestExecutor


General
-------
unit test the lib - started
create lib/include structure
ensure gcc/linux support


Stretch
-----
custom xUnitAsserts per assert (revisit unit tests at that point)
consider doing LINEINFO the way VS2012 does
support wstring - what does that mean?
    - as an assert call paarameter?
    - define std::tstring and add yet another set of compile targets?
create NuGet package/template (NuGet does not support C++ projects, yet)
