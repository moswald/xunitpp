General
-------
finish unit testing the lib
    - ensure tests are actually ran
        - will require new project
    - ensure output formats
    - ensure all failing assert types actually increment count of failed tests
    - include new Check asserts
    - several tests (look at Theory.cpp) do not actually assert anything happened
check Release builds for warnings (and failing tests)
can runner be made configuration agnostic? (ie, can debug runner load release tests, and vice versa? (and what about x64?)
redo include structure
vsix project needs embedded eula and license
need license for whole project

Wiki
----
update install/build stuff: paths have changed


Stretch
-----
would be nice to have some logging support (Log::Information("msg")) (see how Check was implemented)
msbuild test runner
GUI runner (windows only, or go QT?)
custom xUnitAsserts per assert (revisit unit tests at that point)
support wstring as an assert call parameter/output
create NuGet package/template (NuGet does not support C++ projects, yet)
