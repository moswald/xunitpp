General
-------
finish unit testing the lib
    - ensure output formats
    - several tests (look at Theory.cpp) do not actually assert anything happened
redo include structure
vsix project needs embedded eula and license
need license for whole project

Wiki
----
update install/build stuff: paths have changed


Stretch
-----
would be nice to have some logging support (Log::Information("msg")) (see how Check was implemented)
msbuild test runner
GUI runner (windows only, or go QT?)
custom xUnitAsserts per assert (revisit unit tests at that point)
support wstring as an assert call parameter/output
create NuGet package/template (NuGet does not support C++ projects, yet)
