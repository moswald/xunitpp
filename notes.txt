Visual Studio 2012 notes
------------------------
will need to export a function that reports a list of tests - started
implement ITestDiscoverer and ITestExecutor


General
-------
unit test the lib - started
create lib/include structure, create NuGet package/template
ensure gcc support
xml output
support wstring
support versions of DoesNotContain/Contains that call find_if


"2.0"
-----
custom xUnitAsserts per assert (revisit unit tests at that point)
consider doing LINEINFO the way VS2012 does
external test runner (since ITestExecutor will need the same thing) - started
